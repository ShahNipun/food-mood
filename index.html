            <p>A balanced diet can help promote a balanced mood.Improving your diet may help to improve your mood.As
                more tryptophan enters the brain, more serotonin is synthesized in the brain, and mood tends to improve.
                Serotonin, known as a mood regulator, is made naturally in the brain from tryptophan with some help from
                the B vitamins. Foods thought to increase serotonin levels in the brain include fish and vitamin D.</p>

        <h1>Food-Mood Blogs</h1>
        <p>Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in cooking with those of blog
            writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of
            them focus specifically on food photography. </p>

            <h2>Green Kitchen Stories</h2>
            <p>This couple and their beautiful daughter share the stories of their life in Sweden and delight with their
                recipes such as Hearty Spinach Crepes or Rhubarb, Strawberry Quinoa Crumble. Bonus: they make videos.We
                don't know about you guys, but if someone can make a bowl of fruit look THAT good we trust we are in
                good hands. And with My New Roots, you are.

            <h2>Real Food Real Deals</h2>
            <p>Annemarie Rossi, a self-described “regular mom," started a blog to offer simple, healthy, and affordable
                alternatives to processed foods. Real Food Real Deals follows a four-point checklist for each
                recipe—real (avoids overly processed ingredients), easy (30 minutes or less), affordable (recipes
                include the cost breakdown), and flavor (because if it doesn’t taste good, who’s going to eat it?).</p>

            <h2> Easy Meal Prep and Simple Recipes</h2>
            <p>One of the best features about Minimalist Baker from food stylist and photographer Dana Shultz is that
                the recipes themselves are simple and easy to make. At least one of the following qualifiers is true for
                each recipe: takes no more than 30 minutes, requires just one bowl, and includes 10 ingredients or
                fewer. </p>
